# CMU SCS 15-799 | Unnesting Queries

## 1. Introduction

- **Context**: This lecture focuses on how to handle nested subqueries in SQL and how optimizers transform or "un-nest" them into more conventional join-based expressions.
- SQL allows subqueries to exist almost anywhere (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING, LIMIT, etc.), but correlated subqueries can be very inefficient when executed naively.

---

## 2. Subqueries

### 2.1 Uncorrelated Subqueries
- An **uncorrelated subquery** does not reference any attributes from the outer query.  
- The DBMS logically executes it once and reuses the result, e.g.:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
    FROM students
   WHERE score = (SELECT MAX(score) FROM students);
  ```
> Most systems easily detect and handle these by treating the subquery like a constant or small temp table.

### 2.2 Correlated Subqueries
- A **correlated subquery** references attributes from the outer query, so its result can change per outer tuple.
- Logically, the DBMS would re-run the inner query for each tuple in the outer relation. Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, major
    FROM students AS s1
   WHERE score = (
         SELECT MAX(s2.score)
           FROM students AS s2
          WHERE s2.major = s1.major
       );
  ```
> Naive evaluation can lead to O(n²) nested loop behavior. The goal is to rewrite correlated subqueries so they become standard joins or group-by queries. This rewriting is called **unnesting**.

## 3. Subquery Binding

- Subqueries act like function calls, but columns from the outer query can be "passed" into them.
- The DBMS must carefully bind references in each part of the query (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, etc.).
- Certain parts of SQL (e.g., LIMIT) do not allow correlated columns.  
- Different DBMSs can interpret references in nested queries differently, leading to small or large variations in final query plans or even different query results in corner cases.

---

## 4. Heuristic Rewriting

### 4.1 Classic Heuristics
- Since the early 1980s, many systems used sets of rewrite rules to flatten or remove correlated subqueries:
  - **Magic Sets** or “magic” tables can push subquery predicates into the FROM clause.
  - **MSSQL** uses sets of small, orthogonal rules that rewrite APPLY operators into standard relational operators.
  - These approaches can be effective for many patterns but are incomplete.

### 4.2 Tradeoffs
- **Advantages**:
  - Potentially big performance improvements by removing O(n²) nested evaluations.
  - Can be cost-based or rule-based.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Hard to cover every possible query shape or nesting pattern.
  - Hard to maintain large sets of rewriting rules.
  - Complex or deeply nested queries often break or remain non-decorrelated.

## 5. German-Style Unnesting (2015)

Reference: “Unnesting Arbitrary Queries” (Thomas Neumann, BTW 2015).

1. **Motivation**:  
   - Provide a systematic way to transform correlated subqueries into regular joins at the relational algebra level.
   - Represent correlated subqueries as a new operator called **dependent join**, which logically executes the inner query once per tuple in the outer query.

2. **Dependent Join**:
   - Not a standard join. It captures the semantics of “evaluate the RHS for each LHS tuple.”  
   - The goal is to push this operator downward in the plan until it can be replaced by a cross join or standard join.

3. **Flattening Process**:
   - *Step 1:* Introduce a `DEPENDENT_JOIN` operator whenever a subquery references outer columns.
   - *Step 2:* Move the dependent join downward inside the query plan. Possibly add or use a `DUP_ELIM_SCAN` to reduce repeated executions for identical outer values.
   - *Step 3:* Convert `DEPENDENT_JOIN` to `CROSS_JOIN`, if it is pushed low enough.
   - *Step 4:* Convert `CROSS_JOIN` plus filters to a normal inner join. Remove unnecessary filters or scans.  
   - *Outcome:* Correlated subqueries become standard join + group-by expressions. Improves from O(n²) nested loops to a more efficient O(n) or O(n log n) strategy.

4. **Limitations**:
   - Handling multiple deeply nested dependent joins (i.e., several correlated subqueries) can produce suboptimal or complicated plans if each dependent join is removed in isolation, one at a time.

---

## 6. Observation (Multiple Dependent Joins)

- The 2015 approach works well for a single correlated subquery or simpler patterns.
- But a query with multiple nested correlated subqueries can lead to big expansions, cross joins, or massive intermediate states.  
- The user transcript gave examples of a single query “crash.sql” that triggers huge expansions or memory exhaustion in naive bottom-up unnesting.

## 7. German-Style Unnesting (2025): “Holistic Unnesting”

Reference: “Improving Unnesting of Complex Queries” (Thomas Neumann, BTW 2025).

1. **Motivation**:
   - Provide a top-down pass that recognizes and removes all dependent joins holistically in one go.
   - Avoid pushing a dependent join across complex multi-join subplans in ways that cause blow-ups.

2. **Key Ideas**:
   - *Identification Phase*: Traverse the query plan to locate all dependent joins. For each column that a RHS subplan uses, see if it is provided from the LHS.  
   - *Rewrite Phase*: Perform a top-down rewrite so that no references exist from the outer side in the RHS.  
   - Exploit an “indexed algebra” approach (keeping an auxiliary data structure that tracks operator and attribute usage). This helps find where rewriting can happen quickly.

3. **Process**:
   - Start at the top of the plan.
   - For each dependent join, gather all references to outer columns from the LHS in that subquery.
   - Move operators, apply transformations, or unify columns such that references are replaced or merged with local data.
   - The entire set of dependent joins is un-nested at once, which can produce more compact or efficient final plans compared to removing them one-by-one (the 2015 approach).

4. **Advantages**:
   - Eliminates correlated subqueries more robustly.
   - Handles multiple nested dependent subqueries better.
   - May require advanced data structures (e.g., DAG-based plan representation, “indexed algebra”).
   - Achieves more efficient plans for complex queries than older methods.

## 8. Parting Thoughts

- **Holistic unnesting** is the state-of-the-art approach for fully decorrelating subqueries of arbitrary complexity.
- It requires:
  1. A DBMS that can represent and manipulate DAG query plans (not just a tree).
  2. Additional meta-data (indexed algebra) to track exactly which operators produce/consume columns.
- Once subqueries are decorrelated, the DBMS can exploit ordinary cost-based join enumeration.  
- This approach is currently implemented in Umbra (successor to HyPer) and not widely used in older systems.  
- We will see correlated subqueries again in the context of inlining UDFs.

## 9. Conclusion

- **Correlated subqueries** are tricky because the naive approach re-runs the subquery for each outer tuple.  
- **Heuristic rewrites** (magic sets, subquery flattening rules) were used historically, but do not handle every scenario elegantly.  
- **German-style unnesting (2015)** introduced the dependent join operator in a bottom-up rewrite.  
- **Holistic unnesting (2025)** extends that idea to handle multiple dependent joins in a single top-down pass, avoiding large intermediate expansions.
